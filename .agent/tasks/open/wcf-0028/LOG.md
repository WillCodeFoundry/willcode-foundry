Done: TASK.md written and approved by the human. Outcome `planned`: the work
adds methods to `ProjectClone` and `ProjectTasks` and a `TaskSummary` value
type, within those modules' stated jobs; no new module, seam, rule or ADR.
Next (dev): start from TASK.md's "Context". Suggested follow-ups, not part of
this task:
- `foundry repo check` prints per-project errors on stdout, inside its report;
  `task list` prints them as `error: ...` on stderr. Consider making `repo
  check` match.
- Git keeps no empty dir, so `.agent/tasks/open/` vanishes when its last task
  closes; `task list` copes by catching a narrow missing-path error. Consider
  a task that keeps the dir in git (e.g. a `.gitkeep` seeded by `create` and
  kept by `close`), after which that catch could go.
